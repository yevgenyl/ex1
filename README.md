# Undirected Weighted Graph Data Structure and Algorithms
### Project Overview

- This project was built as part of the OOP Course of the Computer Science Department at Ariel University.

- Inside the src folder you can find an implementation of the Graph Theory data structure and algorithms.

- **Project contributors**: Evgueni Lachtchenov

- Below is an illustration of Undirected Weighted Graph **G(V,E)** with 7 vertices and 8 edges:

## WGraph_DS Class

### Class Overview
- This class represents an undirected weighted graph **G(V,E)**

- It supports a large number of nodes (over 10^6, with average degree of 10).

- The implementation is based on a compact and efficient representation using HashMap data structure:

  - **V** - The collection of vertices is implemented by using `HashMap<Integer,node_info>`.
  - **E** - The collection of edges is implemented by using `HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Integer, Double>>`.

- Most of the basic operations (add node, get node, connect nodes.. etc) are running in a constant time O(1).

## WGraph_Algo Class

### Class Overview
- This class represents an Undirected (positive) Weighted Graph Theory algorithms including:

  - clone(); (copy)
  - init(graph);
  - isConnected();
  - double shortestPathDist(int src, int dest);
  - List<node_data> shortestPath(int src, int dest);
  - Save(file);
  - Load(file);

### Algorithms
- The methods: `isConnected`, `shortestPath` and `shortestPathDist` are based on two well known algorithms:

  - **BFS - Breadth-first search:** This algorithm is used by `isConnected` method for traversing the graph.
  - **Dijkstra:** This algorithm is used by `shortestPath` and `shortestPathDist` methods to find the shortest path between two vertices.

## Importing and Using the Project
- In order to be able to use this project, you should have JDK 11 or above (not tetsted on older versions).

- Simply clone this project to you computer and then import it to your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc..).

- Then you should create a new class with `main()` method or use it in any other way that you prefer.

- Below is an example of creating a new weighted graph and adding a vertices to it:
  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args){
    weighted_graph g = new WGraph_DS(); // Creating new weighted graph
    g.addNode(1); // Adding vertices to the graph
    g.addNode(2);
    g.connect(1,2,20); // Connecting node 1 to node 2 and setting the weight to 20.
    g.removeNode(1); // Removing the node which key is 1.
  }
  ```
